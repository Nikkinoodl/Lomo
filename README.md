# Lomo
A GIMP script that emulates the classic look of Diana and Holga camera images.

This plugin is based on the work of https://elsamuko.github.io/gimp-elsamuko/scripts/lomo.html and updates the scripts to work in GIMP 2.10. It has been converted to
Python and updated to work in Gimp 3.0

To install, download the file and place it in the appropriate folder location. You can find this by selecting Edit/Preferences then navigating to Folder->Scripts (for the Gimp 2.10 script) or Folder->Plugins (for the Gimp 3.0 plugin) from the GIMP menu. If you have not already done do, it is much easier to find these folders if you make them visible — in Windows, you can do this from the menu bar in File Explorer.

Install the GIMP 2 script directly in the script folder. Note that the GIMP 3 plugin must be installed inside a sub-folder with the same name as the plugin. The installation location will looks something like those shown below.

Windows:

```

C:\user\<username>\AppData\Roaming\GIMP\2.10\scripts
C:\user\<username>\AppData\Roaming\GIMP\3/0\plugins\gimp_lomo\gimp_lomo.py

```

Linux:

```

/usr/<username>/.config/GIMP/2.10/scripts
/usr/<username>/.config/GIMP/3.0/plugins/gimp_lomo/gimp_lomo.py

```

And that's all there is to it. Open GIMP and you're now ready to go with your new plugin.
